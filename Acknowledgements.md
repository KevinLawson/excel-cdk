# Acknowledgements #

I would like to acknowledge the authors/developers of the excellent Java libraries which LICSS makes extensive use of.  In particular, the CDK, J Chem Paint and Opsin.  This version of LICSS also uses rendering/copying code originally written by Rajarshi Guha.  The new rendering engine uses C++ proxying of Java classes and, for this, the JACE engine is used: http://code.google.com/p/jace/.  The implementation of JACE in LICSS was written by Jonty Lawson of DataLook ltd.  Sammon mapping code was adapted from Java classes orginally written by Jarkko Miettinen (for MZMine).  Clustering code was adapted from Java classes provided by NIH.  RGroup Generation code was written together with Tom Sheldon (ex Syngenta).  The VBA Code Module 'Chart Series' was written by John Walkenbach
